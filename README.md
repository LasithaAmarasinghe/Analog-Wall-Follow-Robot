**Introduction**

* • Wall following robot is a robot that follows a wall and travels keeping a constant distance from the wall. 
* • Wall following is a common task in many robotics competitions.
* • But the interesting thing is our project was to build a robot that travels on the centerline between two walls, using only analog electronics. That means we couldn’t use microcontrollers.
