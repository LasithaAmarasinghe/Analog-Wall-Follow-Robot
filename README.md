**Introduction**

In the realm of automation, robotics has emerged as a prominent force, seamlessly integrating into tasks ranging from modest automation assignments to the complexities of self-driving cars. This challenge involves constructing a basic wall-following robot using analog electronic components. The primary objective is to gauge the robot's distance from adjacent walls using analog sensors and subsequently employ a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control circuit to generate a signal steering the robot to travel along the central path between the walls. To make a robot that sticks to the middle of two walls, we need to put together three main things: special sensors to measure how far the robot is from the walls, a smart control system called PID that helps the robot stay in the middle, and a mechanism to drive the motors so the robot moves smoothly and stays on course. It's like creating a team of components that work together to guide the robot and keep it in the right place between the walls.
