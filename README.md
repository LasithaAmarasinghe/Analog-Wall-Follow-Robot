The task description of the project is as follows.

**1.Introduction**

In the realm of automation, robotics has emerged as a prominent force, seamlessly integrating into tasks ranging from modest automation assignments to the complexities of self-driving cars. This challenge involves constructing a basic wall-following robot using analog electronic components. The primary objective is to gauge the robot's distance from adjacent walls using analog sensors and subsequently employ a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control circuit to generate a signal steering the robot to travel along the central path between the walls. To make a robot that sticks to the middle of two walls, we need to put together three main things: special sensors to measure how far the robot is from the walls, a smart control system called PID that helps the robot stay in the middle, and a mechanism to drive the motors so the robot moves smoothly and stays on course. It's like creating a team of components that work together to guide the robot and keep it in the right place between the walls.

**2.Specifications**

  * Build a simple wall following robot with a PID controller which keeps the robot at the center as it travels.
  * Use of analog distance measurement sensors.
  * Use analog electronics for the implementation. (transistors, operational amplifiers) 
  * The robot should be able to track the center line between walls with minimum latency.
  * Evaluated based on the design, speed, and performance of the robot.
  * A design with 2 motors will be sufficient.
  * You can use a robot kit with a chassis (but you are encouraged to come up with a custom design). 
  * The wall height is 7 cm.
  * The width between walls is 30 cm.
  * The maximum robot size is 15 cm x 15 cm.
  
**3.Additional Notes**

* Any change of project specification is negotiable only before the mid-review
* All circuits must be simulated using software (e.g., Multisim, LTspice, PLECs)
* All circuits should be tested on the breadboard and reviewed by the assigned supervisor before moving further
* Circuits must be designed using professional EDA software (e.g., Altium Designer, OrCAD)
* Schematics should be verified and evaluated by the assigned supervisor
* Design for manufacturability should be considered when designing the PCB
* Complete set of design and manufacturing documents – Schematics, Layout, 3D file – Gerber files, Assembly files – BoM must be generated and properly documented.
* Students are encouraged to procure components from international component distributors (e.g., Mouser, DigiKey, Arrow Electronics, LCSC)
* Students are encouraged to get the PCBs manufactured from international PCB manufacturers (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBway)
* The main functionality of the project must be achieved with basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors and other analog integrated circuits.
* Using any other pre-built programmable ICs is prohibited.
* Microcontrollers can be only used for user interface operation.
* Enclosure design must be done using professional software (Solidworks)
* Enclosure and 3D model of the circuit must be assembled and inspected before manufacturing.
* 3D printing, Laser cutting, and Sheet metal bending can be used to manufacture the enclosure.
* Students are encouraged to consider the 3D model and PCB co-design (design in parallel by considering their integration) when designing.
* The final implementation of the project needs to be done in a PCB.
* Follow the provided “General guidelines”.
